I'm Creative Liberties, this is the GitHub page for the half of the channel that I like to call "CodeLiberties", I always noticed a problem with a lot of programming tutorials, they're boring. They never have any sense of fun to them so it's hard to stay engaged with
the content, I figured I would try to change that by making tutorials the way I would want to have them, if no one else wants that and prefers the way everyone else does them? so be it, I don't mind, but hopefully there's people out there who want to learn but have 
the same problem I had, and hopefully I can make their learning a little bit easier.
